🚦 Accident Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Abstract

This project presents a machine learning-based system designed to predict road accident occurrence and severity using historical traffic and road safety data. The system analyzes multiple accident-influencing factors such as weather conditions, road type, traffic density, time of day, speed limits, and driver behavior to identify high-risk scenarios.

🎯 Objectives

Predict accident occurrence (Yes/No)

Classify accident severity (Low, Medium, High)

Compare multiple classification algorithms

Identify the most reliable model for real-world application

🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

After performance comparison, Random Forest was selected due to:

Higher predictive accuracy

Better handling of complex feature interactions

Robustness against missing data

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

📈 Key Findings

Bad weather and wet roads significantly increase accident probability.

High traffic density during nighttime shows higher accident severity.

Random Forest outperformed other classifiers in overall performance.

🌍 Real-World Impact

The system demonstrates how predictive analytics can support:

Road safety authorities

Smart city planning

Traffic monitoring systems

Driver alert systems
